## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project let me get some additional practice in utilizing flexbox with responsive screen layouts to change the positioning of certain elements based on the amount of screen realestate. This is something I have limited practice with so it was quite nice to be able to get some additional experience in this area.
